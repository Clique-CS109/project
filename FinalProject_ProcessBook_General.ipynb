    "##1. Overview\n",
    "Online book store in Korea is as prosperous as in any other countries in the world. It has about 36% of entire book market share in Korea, and this number is consitently growing every year. <i>Yes24</i> is the leading online book store in Korea, occupying about 44% of online book market. However, <i>Yes24</i>'s book recommender system is not so good that it often recommends totally irrelavant books, or even a goods that is not a book. <i>Yes24</i> recently opened a competition where data scientists suggest a solution for accurate book recommender, releasing the purchase history of 19,000 users within 2014. This motivated us to build a book recommeder algorithm, using the technique we've learned throughout the semester in CS109. <br><br>\n",
    "We've tried three different algorithms: one is the simplest algorithm that <i>Yes24</i> supposedly uses on their current website, and the others are based on k-nearest neighbor (kNN) with user similarity and book similarity. As a result, we found that kNN with user similarity has the best recommendation accuracy."

    "\n",
    "A first and the important step is cleaning the given raw data. In our case, we have `cancel` and `return` transactions along with `purchase` ones. However, `cancel` and `return` transactions should not be considered since the recommendation of books heavily rely on what the customer purchased before. Moreover, when we remove the `cancel` and `return` transactions, corresponding `purchase` transactions should be removed as well. \n",

We'll drop remaining 273 transactions as well, and only consider 488,874 transactions. For the purpose of this project, we only take into account following 5 large categories: `Domestic Literature`, `Humanities`, `Self Development`, `Religion`, `International Literature`.\n",

    "Once we do all the data cleaning works, we can now move on to the training-validate-test split process. As we have done in the homework. What we do here is we consider customers with more than (or equal to) $N$ purchases. For those who have made more than $N$ purchases, we choose randomly $M$ transactions and put them to validate set, and randomly select another $L$ transactions (exclusively) to put them into test set. $N$, $M$, and $L$ differ from category to category. Those numbers are determined heuristically. More detailed explanation along with executable code can be found in the ipython notebook of `Data_Exploration.ipynb`.
